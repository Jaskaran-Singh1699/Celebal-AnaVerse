Anamoly detection is a supervised classification problem based on given sensor data and a target variable, the flow of the notebook is simple as a basic approach and the main focus is on showcasing the skills of Data Science.

* The locations used in loading the datasets is for local machine only(if not changed yet by me) these must be changed on every execution by different user.
* 6 ML Algorithms were experimented and RandomForest was found one with a good F1-score.
* It is assumed that the user/examiner is acquinted with ML and Data Science skills and has required dependencies already installed.
* Provided Data sets are quite imbalanced and are of very large size (1.6M+ rows).
* This has also been committed my the Github Repo.
* Final Visualizations were on hold for once and not made in this submission, shall be added further.
* Author and data are mentioned in the end of the Notebook.
